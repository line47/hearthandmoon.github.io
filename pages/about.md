Concoctress Josie Weber has planted, grown, harvested, and created for many years. In the beginning, she made wellness stocks, syrups, and other medicinal mixtures for family & friends. Hearth + Moon was later forged when Josie started incorporating the knowledge of herbal wellness, healing, and plant medicine. She gained her education during time spent at the [Appalachia School of Holistic Herbalism](http://herbsheal.com/) (ASHH), the [Chestnut School of Herbal Medicine](https://chestnutherbs.com/), [Clarity Stone Medicine](https://claritystonemedicine.com/), and learning from the [Wise Women of Southern Appalachia](https://www.sewisewomen.com/).

Josie practices herbalism, medicine making, flower essences, stone medicine, and is excited to share the wisdom of natural healing and wellness with the community.

Made from the wild, Hearth + Moon products connect you to the earth with love and intention.

We're looking forward to sharing our creations with you!

*All botanicals used in our products are organic, locally grown, ethically wildcrafted, or ethically sourced.*
